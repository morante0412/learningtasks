			 <p> The perfect company for a cool, rainy day in the Philippines is a nice hot bowl of bulalo.

Especially known for this dish is the province of Batangas in the country’s Southern Luzon region.</p></center></div>
			 <div>Pork Barbecue<center><img src="barbecue.jpg">
			 <p>A merienda (snack in between meals) favourite in the Philippines is Pinoy pork barbecue. While this skewered sweet meat goes wonderfully well with the ubiquitous plain rice during meals, there’s also nothing like catching yourself hungry in the middle of the afternoon and conveniently walking down the street over to the vendors grilling them road-side for only PHP15 ($0.30) a stick. </p></center> </div>
