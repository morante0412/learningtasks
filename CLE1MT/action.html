		  As stated before, political corruption is detrimental to our society. However, there are ways to which we can undertake to prevent and combat corruption.
	  </p>
	  <ul>
		  <li> We as the people should understand corruption and all its forms first. The better we understand it, the more we are aware of it. </li>
		  <li> We as citizens should have an effective and relevant way to engage and participate in our government. Doing so gives us power over otherwise one-sided conversations between the government and its people. </li>
		  <li> Cut on red tape. The sooner we clamp down on illegal practices, the faster we punish its offenders. </li>
		  <li> Use technology such as social media to serve as a platform against corruption’s practices. </li>
		  <li> Better the monitoring and delivery of government services. </li>
		  <li> Align anti-corruption practices with the interests of the people. </li>
		  <li> Proper and lawful punishment to offenders to discourage others from doing the same. </li>
		  <li> Highlight corruption and all it’s forms on platforms such as media as a way for public information to be given to the people. </li>
		  <li> Vote for who do you think deserves a position in the government. Vote wisely. Having the right people in power goes a long way. </li>
