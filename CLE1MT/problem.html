		  (2) Government funds that could have been used to improve education, health and infrastructure are instead minimized to be split between the corrupt government officials for their own personal gain and the actual project intended for the betterment of our society. 
		  (3) According to a report by Global Financial Integrity, more than an amount of 410 billion US dollars was lost between the years 1960 and 2011 due to illicit activities in the Philippines, this huge sum could have been potentially used for the betterment of the country but was instead lost due to in no small spart, to corruption.

		  As stated above, political corruption is detrimental to our society. However, we may combat corruption through the distribution of information through Media.
