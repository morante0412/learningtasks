Additionally, 
		  corruption most affects the poor, the negative impact of corruption on the distribution of goods and services affects us all, but especially of the lower class. A scenario like the recent government ayudas for the pandemic or natural disasters in which the government spends funds to the impoverished could be sabotaged by corruption.
