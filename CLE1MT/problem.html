		  Political Corruption is the use of powers by government officials for illegitimate private gain.

	  <p>
		  In the Philippines, corruption is a widespread problem that persists today in our society. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  (1) According to GAN Integrity's Philippines Corruption Report last May of 2020, the Philippines suffers from numerous incidents of corruption and crime, which run rampant throughout the state's judicial system, police service, public services, land administration, and natural resources.

		  To what political corruption means to a society. 
		  Government funds that could have been used to improve education, health and infrastructure are instead minimized to be split between the corrupt government officials for their own personal gain rather than for the actual project intended for the betterment of our society. 
		  (3) According to a report by Global Financial Integrity, more than an amount of 410 billion US dollars was lost between the years 1960 and 2011 due to illicit activities in the Philippines, this huge sum could have been potentially used for the betterment of the country but was instead lost due to in no small spart, to corruption. Additionally, 
		  corruption most affects the poor, the negative impact of corruption on the distribution of goods and services affects us all, but especially of the lower class. A scenario like the recent government ayudas for the pandemic or natural disasters in which the government spends funds to the impoverished could be sabotaged by corruption.
