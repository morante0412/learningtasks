		  To what political corruption means to a society. 
		  Government funds that could have been used to improve education, health and infrastructure are instead minimized to be split between the corrupt government officials for their own personal gain rather than for the actual project intended for the betterment of our society.

A scenario like the recent government ayudas for the pandemic or natural disasters in which the government spends funds to the impoverished could be sabotaged by corruption.
